Dates: June 4-June 10, 2020
Mode: Web 
Sample: Subsample
Language: English and Spanish
N=9,654

After data collection was completed, Ipsos brought to our attention that there were a few text edits missed when fielding Wave 68 that have impacted the full English launch.  The final three English text edits that were put in and approved for the soft launch:
- FLOYDFOL: text change to question text ('died' to 'was killed'; English full launch respondents saw 'died')
- FLOYDSM: punch 2 text change ('A little' to 'Some'; English full launch respondents saw 'A little')
- NEWSHEARD: item B text change ('Police firing tear gas so Donald Trump could make a statement in front of a historic church damaged during protests' to 'Law enforcement firing gas at protesters before Donald Trump walked to make an appearance at a historic church damaged in earlier protests'; English full launch respondents saw the former)

The result of this error was that 503 respondents saw the correct version while 9,151 saw the incorrect version. Variable FLAG_W68 in the dataset indicates affected respondents. Footnotes were added to the questionnaire for FLOYDFOL and FLOYDSM. 
There was no discernible effect on responses between the two versions for questions FLOYDFOL and FLOYDSM. Responses to NEWSHEARD_B differed too much between the two versions and thus was deemed unusable. NEWSHEARD items C, H and K were also deemed to have been indirectly affected and were also deemed unreliable. These four items were removed from the dataset. 

NEWSHEARD items A, D, E and F were renamed to L, M, N and O, respectively, after data collection so as to not interfere with other variables with those names that were used in previous surveys. 


Questions COVIDMVWY and COVIDMVWRE contain backcoded responses to the other (specify) where applicable. 


Some variables from the first Pathways wave (W57) and the April Pathways wave (W66) have been added to this dataset so that crosstabs for those key variables can be analyzed with this wave. 
Variables included:
- GROUP_TRUST_a_W57
- NEWS_MOST_W57
- TALKPOL_W57
- FOLELECT_W57
- COVIDNEWSRELY_W66

Created variables include:
- CR_PARTYNEWSUSE_W57
- CR_NEWS_INFLU_W57
- CR_DIG_SAV_W57
- CR_MAINSOPOL_GROUPS_W57
- CR_KNOWLEDGE_INDEX_W57
